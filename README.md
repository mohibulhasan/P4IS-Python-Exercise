# Exercise 3:

Create a page with a button and three input boxes, labelled a, b, and n. <br>
When the user clicks, create a function to return the sum of all the multiples of a or b below n. <br>
Call the function and alert the user to the correct answer when they press the button.

# Exercise 4:

f4 should take 2 integer and 1 array parameters and return an integer.<br>
Create a function f4 to return the sum of all the multiples of a or b in array l
Create a page with a button and three input boxes, labelled a, b and l, l should be a large input. <br>
Call the function f4 in the function called by onClick, and alert the user to the returned answer when they press the button.

# Exercise 5: Arrays: f5 should take array parameters and return an integer.
Create a function f5 to return the sum of all the multiples of factors in a found in in l (a and l should be arrays of integers, a is of length 2)<br>
***(Exercise 5.1)*** Create a page with a button and two wide input boxes, labelled a and l<br>
        Call the function f5 in the function called by onClick, and alert the user to the returned answer when they press the button.<br>
        You may find the split function useful for creating arrays from the strings entered: Split

# Exercise 6.1: Arrays: f6 should take array parameters and return an integer.
Create a function f6 to return the sum of all the multiples of factors in a found in l (a and l should be arrays of integers)<br>
## Exercise 6.1 
Create a page with a button and two wide input boxes, labelled a and l<br>        
Call the function f6 in the function called by onClick, and alert the user to the returned answer when they press the button.<br>
You may find the split function useful for creating arrays from the strings entered.

# Exercise 7: Arrays: Objects as dictionaries/hashtables: </p> 
Create a function, f7, that takes two parameters, basket and prices <br>
f7 should compute the cost of the basket given the prices supplied. <br>
basket should be an object holding product:quantity (string:int) pairs and <br>
prices should be an object holding product:price (string:float) pairs.
